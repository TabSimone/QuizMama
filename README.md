# QuizMama
Simple quiz made with Java and JavaFX. It is my first project made, here for sentimental value.

Here is the Homepage. In here you can see two default quiz (Fish and Meat), but you can, in addition, use a personal quiz (an example is provided in the main folder).
Also there is the best scores made.
You can do all of the above while you will listen a smooth jazz song that starts when you click on the jar (use Command Prompt!).
