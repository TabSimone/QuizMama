# QuizMama
Simple quiz made with Java and JavaFX. It is my first project made, here for sentimental value.

Here is the Homepage. 

There are two default quiz (about Fish or Meat), but you can, in addition, use a personal quiz in a .txt file (an example is provided in the main folder).
You can see also the best scores made.

When you will start the jar file (use Command Prompt!), you will listen to a background smooth jazz song.
